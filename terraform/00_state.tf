# Here we configure the state backend. For this demo we're using the "local"
# backend which stores everything in a local directory. The config you see below
# is functionally equivalent to the defaults.

#terraform {
#  backend "local" {
#    path = "terraform.tfstate"
#  }
#}

# TODO - Consider storing state remotely on a per-instance basis. 
# In that case we'd generate a backend config just before
# running terraform that would look something like this:

terraform {
   backend "gcs" {}
}

data "terraform_remote_state" "state" {
    backend = "gcs"
    config = {
        bucket = "${var.bucket_name}"
    }
}

# Interpolations are not supported in backend configs so we'd have to generate
# the file rather than rely on env vars like we can do almost everywhere else.
